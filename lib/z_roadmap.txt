Every message waters a flower in your chat garden.
Talk more → Garden grows.
Be chaotic → Your plant grows weird (like a mushroom with hearts).
Friendship = Floriculture. 💐🌱

 Cosmic Reflection™
Users unlock custom mirror reflections that show their chat personality:
Mirror of Vibes: The mirror changes its design based on your behavior — if you’re posting lots of positive messages, it sparkles with gentle light, but if you’re more chaotic, it shows a swirling galaxy.
Messages Reflect Personality: Tap your mirror and the app tells you what personal traits you've been showing in your chats (e.g., “You’ve been sending lots of love lately” or “You’ve been a chaotic soul recently 💀”).

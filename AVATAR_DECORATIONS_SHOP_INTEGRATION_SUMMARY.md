## Technical Implementation

### Purchase Flow
1. User views decorations in shop (category ID: 8)
2. User purchases decoration with coins
3. Item added to `user_inventory` table as type 'decoration'
4. `AvatarDecorationService.loadUserDecorations()` checks inventory for ownership
5. Only owned decorations appear in avatar customization screen

### Integration Points
- **Shop Screen**: Decorations appear as purchasable items with preview images
- **Avatar Customization**: Only shows decorations user owns from purchases
- **Profile Display**: Users can equip purchased decorations on their avatars
- **Inventory System**: Tracks decoration ownership and equipped status

## Benefits
1. **Monetization**: All decorations now generate coin engagement
2. **Fair Access**: No premium restrictions - everything purchasable with gameplay
3. **Progressive Unlocking**: Users unlock decorations through coin earning
4. **Enhanced Customization**: 55+ animated decorations for avatar personalization
5. **Shop Integration**: Seamless integration with existing shop system

## Database Schema
- Uses existing `shop_items`, `user_inventory`, and `user_rewards` tables
- Leverages current shop purchase flow and coin economy
- Maintains RLS (Row Level Security) policies for user data protection

## Next Steps
1. Run the SQL migration to populate shop with decorations
2. Test purchase flow for decorations in the shop
3. Verify avatar customization screen shows only owned decorations
4. Ensure proper coin deduction and inventory management
5. Consider adding decoration bundles or themed collections for better value

This implementation transforms the avatar decoration system into a fully integrated shop experience while maintaining the existing game economy and user interface patterns.
